Components and Interactions:

Data Simulator (simulator.py):

Generates simulated stock market data (symbol, timestamp, price, volume).
Publishes the data to an "ingestion" topic in Amazon MSK.
Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka):

Acts as the central message broker for real-time data streams.
Receives data from the Data Simulator.
Provides the stock-market-data topic for Spark to consume.
Provides the stock-alerts topic for the Alerting Engine to publish to and AWS Lambda to consume from.
Spark Master (EC2 Instance):

Manages the Spark cluster.
You submit the Spark Streaming application to the master node using spark-submit.
Spark Workers (EC2 Instances):

Run the Spark Streaming application (spark_app.py).
Consume data from the stock-market-data topic in MSK.
Perform windowed aggregations (average price, total volume).
Calculate the 5-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
Write the processed data (including SMA) to Amazon S3 (for the data lake) and PostgreSQL (RDS).
Amazon S3 (Data Lake):

Stores processed data in a structured format (e.g., Parquet) for long-term storage, analysis, and potential use by other applications.
PostgreSQL (RDS):

Stores the aggregated data (average price, volume, SMA) for use by the Alerting Engine.
Alerting Engine (alerter.py):

Reads the aggregated data from PostgreSQL (RDS).
Evaluates alert conditions (e.g., price crosses above SMA).
Publishes alerts to the stock-alerts topic in MSK.
Writes alerts to Amazon DynamoDB.
AWS Lambda (Alert Consumer):

Triggered by new messages in the stock-alerts topic in MSK.
Consumes alerts and sends notifications (e.g., via email using SES, SMS using SNS, or other notification services).
Amazon DynamoDB:

Stores alerts generated by the Alerting Engine for persistence and querying.
Web App (Optional - API Gateway + Lambda):

Provides a user interface to view alerts.
API Gateway: Exposes an API endpoint to access the alerts.
Lambda: Fetches alerts from DynamoDB and returns them to the frontend.
Data Flow:

Stock data is generated by the Data Simulator and sent to MSK.
Spark Workers consume data from MSK, process it, and write to S3 and PostgreSQL.
The Alerting Engine reads data from PostgreSQL, checks for alerts, and sends alerts to MSK and DynamoDB.
The AWS Lambda Alert Consumer is triggered by new alerts in MSK, consumes them, and sends notifications.
(Optional) The Web App's Lambda function, triggered by API Gateway, reads alerts from DynamoDB and displays them to the user.
Key Improvements for Production-Readiness:

Managed Services: Uses managed services like MSK, RDS, and Lambda to reduce operational overhead.
Scalability: MSK, Spark on EC2, and Lambda can all be scaled to handle large data volumes and high throughput.
Data Lake: Incorporates S3 as a data lake for long-term storage and analysis.
Serverless: Uses Lambda for the alert consumer and potentially the web app backend, making them more scalable and cost-effective.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Can be fully defined using AWS CloudFormation, making deployments repeatable and automated.
Monitoring and Logging: Integrates with CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alarms.
Security: Uses IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources.
Further Considerations:

CI/CD: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment of your application and infrastructure.
Security Hardening: Implement security best practices for all components (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, network security, vulnerability scanning).
Cost Optimization: Choose appropriate instance types and scaling policies to optimize costs.
Disaster Recovery: Design a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of failures.
This diagram and explanation provide a solid foundation for understanding the architecture of your real-time stock alerting system.
Remember that this is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation will involve more detailed design decisions and configurations within each component.
